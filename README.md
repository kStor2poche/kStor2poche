# Welcome to kStor2poche's github page !  

## About me  
I'm a french student of [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/) interested in various domains of computer science, ranging from shaders to cybersecurity (and many other things in the middle, including linux).  

## What I have done  
I have some decent bases in bash, python, java, php, c++ and rust !  
I sometimes train on codewars, and reached a 5 kyu level in c++ on my [profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/Jauttaro%20Coudjau).  
And also try to write some GLSL shaders on [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/kStor2poche).
There are also some fun things I'm currently writing in rust in my repos :)

## What I'm learning  
I'm learning many cybersecurity related things (thanks to [HackademINT](https://www.hackademint.org/)), more details on that on my [Root-me](https://www.root-me.org/kStor2poche) profile.  
I'm currently focusing on going more in depth in the wonderful topic that is reverse engineering !  
  
I'm also partaking to the creation of some challenges for the [404 CTF](https://www.404ctf.fr/), writeups available on the [404CTF-2023](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main) github repo !  
The challenges I worked on are [L'Inondation](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/Programmation/LInondation), [L'Inspiration en images](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/RetroIngenierie/LInspirationEnImages), [Un Courrier suspect](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/SecuriteMaterielle/UnCourrierSuspect) and [Un Réveil difficile](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/SecuriteMaterielle/UnReveilDifficile).
