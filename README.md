# Hi !  
Name's kStor2poche, I'm a student of french engineering school [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/).

I'm interested in various domains of computer science, ranging from shaders to cybersecurity (and many other things in the middle, including linux).  

## I program things 💻
The languages I'm using are **bash**, **python**, **java**, **php**, **c++**, **c#**, **c** and more lately **rust 🦀** !  

I'm currently mostly writing some fun things in rust on some of my repos and will probably use that language for my upcoming projects :)

You can also see some of my older code on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Jauttaro%20Coudjau), where I reached a 5 kyu level in c++ !  
And on [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/kStor2poche), where I will try to write some more GLSL shaders when I have time...  

## Practice cybersecurity 🔒
I've learned and am still learning many cybersecurity related things at [HackademINT Cybersecurity 🐧](https://www.hackademint.org/), mainly using the [root-me](https://www.root-me.org/kStor2poche) platform and participating in some CTFs !  
> _currently going more in depth in the wonderful topic that is reverse engineering !_  
  
## And make challenges for CTFs 🚩 !
I'm also partaking in the creation of challenges for the [404 CTF](https://www.404ctf.fr/), writeups available on the [404CTF-2023](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main) and [404CTF-2024](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2024/tree/main) github repo !  

The challenges I worked on are [L'Inondation (2023)](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/Programmation/LInondation), [L'Inspiration en images (2023)](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/RetroIngenierie/LInspirationEnImages), [Un Courrier suspect (2023)](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/SecuriteMaterielle/UnCourrierSuspect), [Un Réveil difficile (2023)](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/SecuriteMaterielle/UnReveilDifficile) and [Serial killer (2024)](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2024/tree/main/SecuriteMaterielle/SerialKiller).  

I also made the CTFs's css theme for the 2024 edition (though sources are private) !
