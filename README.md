<h2>About me !</h2>
I'm a french student of Telecom SudParis interested in various domains of computer science, ranging from shader to cybersecurity (and many other things in the middle, including linux <3).  
<h2>what I know</h2>
I have some decent bases in bash, python and java !  
<h2>what I'm learning</h2>
How to use the things I already know further more, some C, C++ and many cybersecurity related things (thanks to hackademINT)  
  
I'm also participating to the creation of some challenges for the [404 CTF](https://www.404ctf.fr/)
