# Welcome to kStor2poche's github page !  

## About me  
I'm a french student of [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/) interested in various domains of computer science, ranging from shaders to cybersecurity (and many other things in the middle, including linux ).  

## What I know  
I have some decent bases in bash, python, java and c++ !  
I sometimes train on codewars, and reached a 5 kyu level in c++ on my [profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/Jauttaro%20Coudjau).  
And also try to write some GLSL shaders on [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/kStor2poche).

## What I'm learning  
How to use the things I already know further more, some c, rust and many cybersecurity related things (thanks to [HackademINT](https://www.hackademint.org/))  
  
I'm also participating to the creation of some challenges for the [404 CTF](https://www.404ctf.fr/), writeups available on the [404CTF-2023](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main) github repo !  
The challenges I worked on are [L'Inondation](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/Programmation/LInondation), [L'Inspiration en images](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/RetroIngenierie/LInspirationEnImages), [Un Courrier suspect](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/SecuriteMaterielle/UnCourrierSuspect) ainsi qu'[Un Réveil difficile](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/SecuriteMaterielle/UnReveilDifficile).
