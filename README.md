# Hi!  
Name's kStor2poche! I'm interested in various domains of computer science, ranging from shaders to cybersecurity (and many other things in the middle, including linux).  

## I program things 💻
The languages I'm using are **rust 🦀**, **c** and **python** amongst others!  

I'm currently mostly writing some fun things in rust on some of my repos and will probably use that language for my upcoming projects :)

You can also see some of my code on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Jauttaro%20Coudjau)!  

## Practice cybersecurity 🔒
I've learned and am still learning many cybersecurity related things at [HackademINT Cybersecurity 🐧](https://www.hackademint.org/), mainly using the [root-me](https://www.root-me.org/kStor2poche) platform and participating in some CTFs!  
> _currently going more in depth in the wonderful topic that is reverse engineering!_  
  
## And make challenges for CTFs 🚩!
I'm also partaking in the creation of challenges for the [404 CTF](https://www.404ctf.fr/), writeups available on the [404CTF-2023](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main), [404CTF-2024](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2024/tree/main) and [404CTF-2025](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2025) github repos!  

The challenges I worked on are [L'Inondation (2023)](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/Programmation/LInondation), [L'Inspiration en images (2023)](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/RetroIngenierie/LInspirationEnImages), [Un Courrier suspect (2023)](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/SecuriteMaterielle/UnCourrierSuspect), [Un Réveil difficile (2023)](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2023/tree/main/SecuriteMaterielle/UnReveilDifficile), [Serial killer (2024)](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2024/tree/main/SecuriteMaterielle/SerialKiller) and [RFC 9452 bis IP over Rockets with Quality of Service (2025)](https://github.com/HackademINT/404CTF-2025/tree/main/RetroIngenierie/RFC%209452%20bis:%20IP%20over%20Rockets%20with%20Quality%20of%20Service).  

I also made the CTFs's css theme for the 2024 edition! (though sources are private)
